## About

I am a soon to be graduate from the University of Milwaukee Wisconsin as well as Actualize Coding Bootcamp. I started my education and working career focused on design and multimedia, but I have since made the full transition to coding and full-stack software development. Design introduced me to full-stack web development and helped me to realize my passion for not only front-end development, but back-end development as well. I am very excited to continue learning and to bring my skill set to help companies achieve their goals.
